        <p>Analysts estimate that Twitter’s interest burden will increase to $845 million annually from $51 million in 2021. 
            That is more than half of the company’s adjusted annual earnings of $1.4 billion in 2021, and the new debt would 
            increase leverage to nearly nine times its annual adjusted earnings, up from currently three-and-a-half times.
            At present, Twitter has a little more than $5 billion in debt, mostly in the form of low-interest convertible 
            bonds and unsecured debt, according to a recent offering memorandum. If shareholders agree to take Twitter private,
            the company will need to pay back all of its existing debt before this new debt is added to its books, analysts said.
            The company’s bond prices have rallied on news of Mr. Musk’s planned buyout to around 102 cents on the dollar.</p>
