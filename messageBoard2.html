                In Western astrology, astrological signs are the twelve 30 degree sectors that make up Earth's 360 degree orbit around the Sun.
                 The signs enumerate from the first day of spring known as the First Point of Aries which is the vernal equinox. 
                The astrological signs are Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces.
                 The Western zodiac originated in Babylonian astrology, and was later influenced by the Hellenistic culture. Each sign was named 
                 after a constellation the sun annually moved through while crossing the sky. This observation is emphasized in the simplified and 
                 popular sun sign astrology. Over the centuries, Western astrology's zodiacal divisions have shifted out of alignment with the 
                 constellations they were named after by axial precession[1] of the Earth while Hindu astrology measurements correct for this shifting
                 .[2] Astrology (i.e. a system of omina based on celestial appearances) was developed in Chinese and Tibetan cultures as well but 
                 these astrologies are not based upon the zodiac but deal with the whole sky.
