        <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
        <p>   GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. 
            It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
             Itâ€™s free, easy to use, and has become central in the movement toward open-source software.
             It also enables developers to upload their own code files to collaborate with their fellow developers.
             There are millions of programmers and hobbyists that download, review, and evaluate each other's work.</p>
